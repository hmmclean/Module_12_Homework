Module 12 - noSQL

# Overview
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles. Data analysis is provided in two jupyter notebook files. In the first file (NoSQL_setup_starter) data was imported from the provided resource file (establishments.json) using mongoimport and records were created, revised, updated, and deleted. in the second file (NoSQL_analysis_starter), 4 questions about the data were answered using comparison operators, sorting and limits as filters then converted to pandas dataframes for easier further analysis.
